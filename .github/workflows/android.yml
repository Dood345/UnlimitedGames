    steps:
      # 1. Check out the repository code
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Set up JDK (Java Development Kit)
      # Modern Android builds often require JDK 17
      - name: Set up JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '17'
          distribution: 'temurin'
          cache: gradle

      # 3. Set up the Android SDK
      # This action downloads and installs the necessary Android SDK components.
      - name: Set up Android SDK
        uses: android-actions/setup-android@v3

      # (Optional but Recommended) Add google-services.json from GitHub Secrets
      # This prevents your build from failing if your app uses Firebase.
      # First, create a secret in your repo named GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON.
      - name: Add google-services.json
        run: echo '${{ secrets.GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON }}' > app/google-services.json

      # 5. Grant execute permission for gradlew
      - name: Grant execute permission for gradlew
        run: chmod +x gradlew

      # 6. Build the project
      # The 'build' task compiles sources, runs tests, and packages the app.
      # It's a good comprehensive check for a CI pipeline.
      - name: Build with Gradle
        run: ./gradlew build

      # (Optional) Upload build artifacts
      # This step saves the generated APK for testing or distribution.
      # - name: Upload build artifacts
      #   uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      #   with:
      #     name: app-debug.apk
      #     path: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
